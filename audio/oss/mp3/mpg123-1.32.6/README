1. Introduction 介绍

This is a console based decoder/player for mono/stereo mpeg audio files, probably more familiar as MP3 or MP2 files.
It's focus is speed. We still need some low-end benchmarks for the current version, but playback should be possible even on i486 CPUs. There is hand-optimized assembly code for i586, MMX, 3DNow, SEE and 3DNowExt instructions, while generic code runs on a variety of different platforms and CPUs.
这是用于单声道/立体声 mpeg 音频文件（可能更常见的是 MP3 或 MP2 文件）的基于控制台的解码器/播放器。
它的重点是速度。我们仍然需要当前版本的一些低端基准，但即使在 i486 CPU 上也应该可以播放。有针对 i586、MMX、3DNow、SEE 和 3DNowExt 指令的手动优化汇编代码，而通用代码可在各种不同的平台和 CPU 上运行。

It can play MPEG1.0/2.0/2.5 layer I, II, II (1, 2, 3;-) files (VBR files are fine, too) and produce output on a number of different ways: raw data to stdout and different sound systems depending on your platform (see INSTALL).
Most tested are Linux on x86 and Alpha/AXP and MacOSX on ppc as the environments the current developers work in.
We are always thankful for user reports on success (and failure) on any platform!
它可以播放 MPEG1.0/2.0/2.5 层 I、II、III (1、2、3;-) 文件（VBR 文件也可以），并以多种不同的方式生成输出：原始数据到 stdout 和不同的声音系统（具体取决于您的平台）（请参阅安装）。
大多数测试是 x86 上的 Linux 和 ppc 上的 Alpha/AXP 和 MacOSX，因为当前开发人员的工作环境是这些。
我们始终感谢用户在任何平台上的成功（和失败）报告！

请查阅手册页 mpg123(1)。下面是一些入门信息。

3.1 Simple Console Usage
简单控制台使用

Mpg123 is a console program - normally it just plays a list of files you specify on command line and that's it. See the included manpage or
Mpg123 是一个控制台程序 - 通常它只播放您在命令行上指定的文件列表，仅此而已。请参阅随附的手册页或

	mpg123 --help

or, for the full story,
或者，阅读全文，

	mpg123 --longhelp

on command line syntax/options. I encourage you to check out the --gapless and --rva-album/--rva-mix options:-)
关于命令行语法/选项。我鼓励您查看 --gapless 和 --rva-album/--rva-mix 选项:-)

In the simple "mpg123 file1.mp3 file2.mp3" mode, the only thing you can do to interact is to press Ctrl+C to skip to next track or end the whole playback if pressing it twice.
在简单的“mpg123 file1.mp3 file2.mp3”模式下，您唯一可以做的交互就是按 Ctrl+C 跳到下一首曲目，或者按两次 Ctrl+C 结束整个播放。

Note that this Ctrl+C behaviour is special to this mode; when any of the following is activated, Ctrl+C will just kill the program like you would expect normally (this changed from earlier versions).
请注意，此 Ctrl+C 行为是此模式所特有的；当激活以下任何一项时，Ctrl+C 将像您通常预期的那样终止程序（这与早期版本不同）。

3.2 Advanced Console Usage

You can change these bindings to key to your liking by modifying term.h .
您可以通过修改 term.h 将这些绑定更改为您喜欢的键。

Note: This interface needs not to be available on _every_ platform/build.
注意：此接口不需要在每个平台/版本上都可用。

Another note: The volume up and down is performed by changing the scale factor (like the -f parameter) ... so the audio is scaled digitally in the given range of the output format (usually 16bits). That means the lowering the volume will decrease the dynamic range and possibly lessen the quality while increasing volume can in fact increase the dynamic range and thus make it better, if you deal with a silent source and no clipping is necessary.
It is a good idea to use RVA values stored in the file for adjusting low volume files, though - mpg123 handles that in addition to your volume setting.
另一个注意事项：音量的调高和调低是通过改变比例因子（如 -f 参数）来执行的...因此音频在给定的输出格式范围内以数字方式缩放（通常为 16 位）。这意味着降低音量会降低动态范围并可能降低质量，而增加音量实际上可以增加动态范围，从而使其更好，如果您处理的是静音源并且不需要剪辑。
不过，使用存储在文件中的 RVA 值来调整低音量文件是一个好主意 - 除了您的音量设置之外，mpg123 还可以处理这一点。

3.3 Control Interface for Frontends
前端控制接口

There used to be several interfaces for frontends left over from that past, but only one of them remains for the present and future:
过去曾有过几个前端接口，但现在和将来只剩下一个：

The Generic Control Interface
通用控制接口

It contains of communication of textual messages via standard input to mpg123 and responses to standard output unless the -s switch for output of audio data on stdout is used - then the responses come via stderr.
它包含通过标准输入向 mpg123 传递文本消息和对标准输出的响应，除非使用 -s 开关在 stdout 上输出音频数据 - 然后响应通过 stderr 发出。

See doc/README.remote for usage.
有关用法，请参阅 doc/README.remote。


4. Speed
速度

mpg123 is fast. Any faster software player is probably based on some hacked mpg123;-)
MPlayer included mpg123 source code in it's mp3lib and we have to be thankful for the MPlayer folks adding SSE, 3DNowExt and AltiVec optimizations over the years, which we were able to backport.
mpg123 速度很快。任何更快的软件播放器可能都是基于一些经过破解的 mpg123；-)
MPlayer 在其 mp3lib 中包含了 mpg123 源代码，我们必须感谢 MPlayer 人员多年来添加的 SSE、3DNowExt 和 AltiVec 优化，我们得以对其进行反向移植。

mpg123 includes the AltiVec optimization since version 0.61 and the SSE and 3DNowExt optimizations since 0.66 .
Also, version 0.66 adds the merged x86 optimization build, which includes every applicable optimization for x86 cpus except the one for i486, wich is a bit special.

Now mpg123 catched up with MPlayer's mp3lib concerning decoding speed on my Pentium M (which supports SSE):
Decoding a certain album (Queensryche's Rage for Order) to /dev/null took 22.4s user time with mpg123-0.66 compared to 24.7s with MPlayer-1.0rc1 .

Also, beginning with mpg123 1.8.0, there are fresh x86-64 SSE optimizations (provided by Taihei Monma) which make mpg123 the fastest MPEG audio decoder in my knowledge also on current 64bit x86 systems.

5. Accuracy

The mpg123 engine is able to decode in full compliance to ISO/IEC 11172-3, for all three layers, using floating point or integer math (the latter since 1.8.1).
Accuracy of 16bit output depends on specific optimization in use and compile-time choice about the rounding mode (which is performance relevant).

The ISO test suite is incorporated in the mpg123 subversion repository under svn://orgis.org/mpg123/test, nightly tests of a build (with high-quality 16bit rounding) are published on the mpg123 website.

Dithered 16bit output is available as an option (the --cpu choices ending with _dither). See

	http://dither123.dyndns.org

on the whereabouts.

6. History

A looooong time ago (mid-90s), Michael Hipp wrote some initial mpg123 and made it _the_ Unix console mp3 player in the following years.
The exact date of birth is fuzzy in human memory, but according to the master himself (Michael) mpg123 started in 1994 as an MP2 player which a year later, 1995, gained MP3 ability.
The core decoder files have mostly 1995 as their birth year listed, so one can say that mpg123 as the layer1,2,3 player was born in 1995.
In any case, that is a looooong time ago for a media player - especially for one that is still alive!

This is the historic description:

	This isn't a new player. It's a fully rewritten version originally based
	on the mpegaudio (FHG-version) package. The DCT algorithm in the
	synthesis filter is a rewritten version of the DCT first seen in the maplay
	package, which was written by Tobias Bading (bading@cs.tu-berlin.de). The
	rewrite was necessary, because the GPL may not allow this copyright mix.
	The mpegaudio package was written by various people from the MPEG/audio
	software simulation group. The maplay is under GPL .. You can find the
	original source code and the mpegaudio package on: ftp.tnt.uni-hannover.de.

	Especially layer3.c common.c and mpg123.h is based on the dist10 package.
	The code is fully rewritten but I'm using sometimes the
	same variable names or similar function names as in the
	original package.

	In the current layer3.c I'm using a DCT36 first seen in Jeff Tsay's
	(ctsay@pasteur.eecs.berkeley.edu) maplay 1.2+ package. His code is
	under GPL .. I also tried the enhancement from Mikko Tommila. His
	code is also in layer3.c (but it's disabled at the moment, because
	it was slightly slower than the unrolled 9 point DCT (at least on
	_my_ system)). Theoretically it should be faster. You may try it on
	your system.

Well, that's how it started...
Official development ceased due to the typical lack-of-time syndrome around 2002 and the free-floating patches began to seize the day.

But before that, Michael wrote or rewrote the essential code; others contributed their bits.
The main message is:

Code is copyrighted by Michael Hipp, who made it free software under the terms of the LGPL 2.1.

Please see doc/ROAD_TO_LGPL, COPYING and AUTHORS for details on that. Note that the only notable legacy non-LGPL file was the old alsa output that didn't work with alsa 0.9/1.0 anymore.
Also, there has been a libao output in the betas 0.60 for a short period. Libao being generally problematic for us because of its GPL license, this output is not distributed anymore in the release packages. There is now a new, LGPLed alsa output that made both the old alsa and libao obsolete for our purposes.
So, the distributed mpg123 releases actually only contain LGPL code, but you get the other files from our subversion repository if you checkout the trunk / version tags.

There has been quite some confusion about the licensing and "freeness" of mpg123 in the past.
The initial "free for private use, ask me when you want to do something commercial" license caused some people to avoid mpg123 and even to write a replacement mimicking the interface but using a different decoding engine - what was not actively developed for too long but entered the "free" software sections.

The Debian (non-free section) and Gentoo distributions cared about the last stable and the last development release of mpg123 over the years with mainly applying security fixes. Thanks go to the distribution maintainers for not letting it alone to bitrot over the years.

Thomas Orgis started to hack on mpg123 in 2004 while working on his personal audio experience with mixplayd and later DerMixD, utilizing the generic control interface. In Feb 2005, he crammed control interface improvements together with Debian's r19 fixes and released the personal fork/patch named mpg123-thor.
Little later that year, Nicholas J. Humphrey independently created the sourceforge project and released an autotooled 0.59r under official GPL flag with Debian and MacOSX fixes.
In the beginning of 2006, Thomas finally decided that he could work "officially" on mpg123 and contacted Michael Hipp for taking over maintainership.
Michael was all-positive about letting mpg123 really live again (and perhaps see version 1.0 some time;-) and also pointed at the sourceforge project that didn't see much activity since the initial release.
A lot of emails and some weeks later there was the two-developer team of Nicholas and Thomas working on merging their mpg123 variants as well as adding some features and fixes to let it shine again.

And there we are now...

Have fun!
